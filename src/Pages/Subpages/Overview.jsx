                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Reduce code length</b> :  EasyC provide inbuild functions for many operations and tasks. So, you donâ€™t need to make your code more lengthier for those functions.</li>
                        <li><b>Reduce human efforts</b>: With EasyC you can perform many operations directly from easyC.h's inbuild functions without putting efforts to make it from scratch.</li>
                        <li><b>Improve production speed</b>: It saves times by reducing the code length and also helps to code faster with our pre build functions and operations.</li>
